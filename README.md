S2AFe - DevSecOps. 
A Scaled Agile approach to Security in DevOps organizations.
Introduction: Why?

Security in IT is fundamentally hard. 

What drives this difficulty is the challenge of what is known as threat asymmetry. 

This is where a defender must protect against *all* attack vectors consistently, however an attacker only needs to find a single vulnerability to launch a successful attack.

Security at scale is very hard.

Our intent with this paper is not to talk about the latest buzzword in technology or the latest tooling in the DevSecOps pipelines, rather to address the fundamental principles of a working DevSecOps security strategy â€“ at scale.
