S2AFe - DevSecOps. 
A Scaled Agile approach to Security in DevOps organizations.

Introduction: Why?

Security in IT is fundamentally hard. 

What drives this difficulty is the challenge of what is known as threat asymmetry. 

This is where a defender must protect against *all* attack vectors consistently, however an attacker only needs to find a single vulnerability to launch a successful attack.

Security at scale is very hard.

Our intent with this paper is not to talk about the latest buzzword in technology or the latest tooling in the DevSecOps pipelines, rather to address the fundamental principles of a working DevSecOps security strategy â€“ at scale.

Some Guidance on this Project:
1. This is not a software project! This is a document that is the foundation of communities. As a result we wish to tap into the group intelligence to adapt over time.
2. A Static PDF version is provided in "main". This is easier to read, however harder to collaborate on. As each main version is released, this PDF will be adapted.
3. This is the first time I have tried to make a document as a project on Github. Please be patient and let me know if I am making any fundamental mistakes.
